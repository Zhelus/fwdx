**FWDX BioBlade** is a in house software for Fort Worth Diagnostics, an assay manufacturer focused on delivering reagents for digital and qPCR platforms. BioBlade will provide FWDX with different functionalities such as a well structured database to store company data (reagents/pathogens/users), the ability to schedule jobs that will generate reports with information such as deletions/mutations allowing FWDX to quickly adapt their assays to the mutated pathogen without having to go searching for the changes themselves.
